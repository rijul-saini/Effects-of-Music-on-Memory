# Effects of Emotion Inducing Music on Short-Term Memory


### Abstract
The intersection of music and cognitive activity has
been studied in various ways. Our study aims to address
the intersection of emotion-inducing music and
cognitive activity to understand the effect of different
types of music. Our experiment consisted of 10
Northeastern Computer Science students. We conducted
a within-subjects study where each student
memorized words in 3 conditions, no music, happy
music, and sad music. We had them complete a memory
test to evaluate their memory performance. The
results showed that participant memory was significantly
better in the control condition than in the 2
music conditions (p < 0.05). This finding revealed
that type of music does have an effect on memory
and opens the door to further research with a larger
variety of music and memory tests to evaluate memory
performance more wholly.
